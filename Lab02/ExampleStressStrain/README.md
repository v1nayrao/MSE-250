These files are meant to serve as a starting point to begin plotting an individual stress-strain curve for a material, as well as calculating it's Young's Modulus and Yield Strength for you.
The .mlx file is meant to be opened in MATLAB, this is where you can change the code to create .jpgs and .figs for the stress and strain of any material. The examples included here are for brass.
I plan on eventually adding more features, such as labels for uniform elongation and for maximum tensile strength.
